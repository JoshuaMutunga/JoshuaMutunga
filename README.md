# 👋 Hi, I’m @JoshuaMutunga
I’m a passionate **Web Developer** and **Graphic Designer** based in Nairobi, Kenya, with a growing interest in **system development**. I love building responsive, user-friendly websites and creating visually appealing designs that make an impact. My goal is to craft digital solutions that resonate with Kenya’s mobile-first audience (90%+ mobile internet usage) while exploring innovative systems to solve real-world problems.

- 👀 **I’m interested in** system development, web development, and graphic design. I enjoy working on projects that blend clean code with stunning visuals, from e-commerce platforms to scalable software systems. I’m excited about technologies that power Nairobi’s vibrant tech ecosystem, like mobile-first web apps and system architecture.

- 🌱 **I’m currently learning** JavaScript frameworks (React, Node.js) and system design principles to build robust, scalable applications. I’m also diving deeper into graphic design tools like Figma and Adobe Illustrator to enhance UI/UX for web projects.

- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on** open-source web development projects, UI/UX design challenges, or system development initiatives that solve local problems in Kenya, such as e-commerce platforms or mobile-first apps. Let’s create something impactful together!
